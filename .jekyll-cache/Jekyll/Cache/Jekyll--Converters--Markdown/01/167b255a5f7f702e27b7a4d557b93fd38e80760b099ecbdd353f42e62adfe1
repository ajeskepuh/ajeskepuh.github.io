<p>I had a problem one year ago, when doing alt+tab in some games in wine. Every time I did alt+tab I lost the focus and the game didn´t get my mouse and keyboard input. I tried with a solution that I found in some page that said that in Regedit, I had to create a new entry named “UseTakeFocus” with value “N” in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\X11 Driver</code></p>

<blockquote class="prompt-info">
  <p>Create New Folder if you don’t see ‘X11 Driver’ folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This worked, and I was able to alt+tab without any problem.</p>
