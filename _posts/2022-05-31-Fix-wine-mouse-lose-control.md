### Mengatasi Mouse Di Wine Kehilangan Fokus
I had a problem one year ago, when doing alt+tab in some games in wine. Every time I did alt+tab I lost the focus and the game didnÂ´t get my mouse and keyboard input. I tried with a solution that I found in some page that said that in Regedit, I had to create a new entry named "UseTakeFocus" with value "N" in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\X11 Driver`

> Create New Folder if you don't see 'X11 Driver' folder.
{: .prompt-info }

This worked, and I was able to alt+tab without any problem.
